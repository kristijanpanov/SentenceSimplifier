A mid-eleventh-century source asserts that Cynehelm briefly succeeded to the throne while still a child, and was then murdered by his tutor Æscberht at the behest of Cwoenthryth. This version of events ``bristles with historical problems'', according to one historian, and it is also possible that Cynehelm is to be identified with an ealdorman who is found witnessing charters earlier in Coenwulf's reign, and who appears to have died by about 812. The opinion of historians is not unanimous on this point: Simon Keynes has suggested that the ealdorman is unlikely to be the same person as the prince, and that Cynehelm therefore may well have survived to the end of his father's reign. Regardless of interpretation of Cynehelm's legend, there does appear to have been dynastic discord early in Ceolwulf's reign: a document from 825 says that after the death of Coenwulf ``much discord and innumerable disagreements arose between various kings, nobles, bishops and ministers of the Church of God on very many matters of secular business''."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"9575511183572255983","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13224617482643406822","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3633697795227880988","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"no"}]}

He continued to sing for Handel, creating roles in ten of his operas and performing in every one of Handel's English-language oratorios, odes, and music dramas, with the sole exception of The Choice of Hercules. He also performed for Thomas Arne, and sang at the Chapel Royal. His marriage, during 1739, to Lady Henrietta Herbert, only daughter of James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave caused much scandal: Lord Egmont commented that ``there is no prudence below the girdle''. Lady Herbert died in 1753 and in 1759 he married again, this time to Charlotte Rich, whose father was the proprietor of the opera house in Covent Garden. After he died in 1761 Beard succeeded to the role until 1767, when deafness forced him to retire, selling Covent Garden's ownership for £60,000. He died at Hampton. Handel created several heroic leading roles for Beard, a revolution in the heyday of the castrato voice. The title roles in Samson, Judas Maccabeus, and Jeptha call for strength and expressive qualities over agility. He also sang the role of Farmer Hawthorne in the world premiere of Thomas Arne's Love in a Village. Charles Burney commented that he ``constantly possessed the favour of the public by his superior conduct, knowledge of Music, and intelligence as an actor.'' Burney's article in Rees's Cyclopaedia noted that Beard, ``an energetic English singer, and an excellent actor, was brought up in the king's chapel. He knew as much of music as was necessary to sing a single part at sight, and with a voice that was more powerful than sweet, he became the most useful and favourite singer of his time, on the stage, at Ranelagh, at all concerts; and in Handel's oratorios he had always a capital part, being by his knowledge of music the most steady support of the choruses, not only of Handel, but in the odes of Green and Boyce''."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"9407096097752083601","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"1568443823013462240","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"9408967419489906475","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"3422319225482654240","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"15683306407052553031","judgment":"no"}]}

Indeed, the German artillery played by far the most important part in the victories of the Franco-Prussian War. Hindersin accompanied the king's headquarters as chief of artillery, as he had done in 1866, and was present at Gravelotte, Sedan and the siege of Paris.

Guarini corresponded and collaborated with other classical scholars and archaeologists of the time, including German archaeologists August Emil Braun and Eduard Gerhard, and German classical scholar and Nobel Laureate Theodor Mommsen. The debates with Mommsen were legendary in their time. Guarini was also a pioneer in the study of the Oscan language. He was a first to create an Oscan/Latin Dictionary. His other works, numbering close to one hundred, range from brief monographs to books. Many of his works can be found today in the libraries of larger colleges and universities (Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Duke, Columbia etc.). By far, the largest collection of his works may be found at the Vatican Library in Rome. Guarini played an important role in the popular Classical Movement of the 1800s, centered at Naples in Southern Italy, after the rediscovery of Pompeii. He died on January 8, 1852 at Naples.

Muslims had become superstitious and gone astray. Islam was being invaded by non-islamic religions, traditions, customs and cultures. Government imposed unnecessary taxes upon the farmers and the low class. Farmers were not appreciated for their hard work nor were given rights or money they deserved. Britishers had crushed the Muslims economically at their arrival in subcontinent so that they could not rise against them. They also made sure that Muslims should remain illiterate and uneducated. Thus, Muslims became politically backward and were unaware of laws and regulations. Due to this, Haji Shariatullah started this movement in 1818. He was sure that a revival of Islam is crucially necessary. Haji Shariatullah awakened the Muslims of Bengal by initiating the Faraizi movement. It was simply a peaceful protest against the cruelty of the government. This alarmed the Hindu and British Landlords and they exiled Haji Shariatullah to Nawabganj, accused of being behin the protest and disturbance in East Bengal. Later he died in Dhaka district in 1840. But the movement was carried along by his son, Mohsin-ul-Mulk, who was more learned and active in the movement than his father.

McWhorter taught, in 1910, a major graduate course in Greek which consisted of literary selections and exercises in grammar, written and spoken Greek, history, and poetry. The course description points out a problem with early graduate education at the University of Georgia that was common with many other institutions: ``studied from sources so far as the library resources of the University permit.'' Bocock also taught, by himself, ``An Introduction to New Testament Greek.'' These classes were in addition to undergraduate teaching and his duties as Dean. The New Testament Greek class was not offered after 1913 and after 1923, Bocock taught the major Greek class by himself. Bocock often decried the declining interest by students in Greek, symptomatic of this is the fact that the 1931-32 Graduate Bulletin notes: ``For courses in Greek Literature, consult the professor.'' 207 After 1931, the Greek Literature class would be transformed into ``Introduction of European Literature'' which had a prerequisite of three years of college-level Latin. Greek literature was no longer studied in the original language but was now ``Greek Literature in Translations.'' In a memorial to Bocock in 1948, Robert Preston Brooks wrote: ``Mr. Bocock was an altogether charming companion. Few men were so perennially delightful. The depth and variety of his knowledge of literature, ancient and modern, and of world history and contemporary affairs was impressive; and he invariably expressed his views in perfect English. No one was ever bored in his presence.'' Bocock continued to serve the Graduate School after leaving the deanship. He served as a member of and advisor to the Graduate Council into the 1940s. He retired from the University of Georgia in 1945. Bocock married Bessie Perry Friend of Petersburg, Virginia in 1885. The Bococks had two children: John Holmes Bocock and Natalie Friend Bocock.

Within a year, however, the Dakins left Gallier and practised for a time together as Dakin & Dakin and as Dakin, Bell & Dakin; later still they split. Charles began an ill-fated branch office in Mobile, Alabama, where he supervised the construction of the Government Street Presbyterian Church, completed in 1836. The collapse of a row of warehouses he designed affected him so deeply that it is thought to have been a cause contributing to his early death in St. Gabriel, Louisiana.

In this capacity he accompanied Lord Hardinge to the Panjab and drew up an admirable memoir on its resources. As foreign secretary he also visited the western frontier with Lord Dalhousie, on the occasion of the Sikh War, and negotiated the treaty with the Sikh chiefs relative to the settlement of the Panjab and Gujarat, and received the K.C.B. for his services (1849). Throughout his official career he had devoted his leisure to study. At a very early period he conducted a magazine at Mirat which contained many valuable articles on Indian subjects. With a view to assisting the projected official 'Glossary of Indian Judicial and Revenue Terms,' he published in 1845 at Agra his 'Supplement to the Glossary,' which is rightly described by Professor H. H. Wilson as 'replete with curious and valuable information, especially as regards the tribes and clans of Brahmans and Rajputs. ' A second edition appeared in 1860. His chief work, however, was the 'Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Mohammadan India,' in which he proposed to give an analysis of the contents and a criticism of the value of 231 Arabic and Persian historians of India, but of which he only lived to publish the first volume (Calcutta and London, 1849).

Most sources say this occurred in Frankfurt, although one Australian source says she died in Cologne. Her obituary by the critic Karl Holl concluded: Her violin playing has been silenced. But it leaves behind a ring of rare purity.

He died at Twickenham on 9 August 1761, aged 68, and was buried in a vault in Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street. Gilbert seems to have possessed few qualifications to justify his high promotion in the church. He was neither a scholar nor a theologian. Nor were these deficiencies compensated by graces of character. A friendly witness, Bishop Newton, speaks of his being regarded as ``somewhat haughty;'' while Horace Walpole, describes him as ``composed of that common mixture of ignorance, meanness, and arrogance.'' John Newton, William Cowper's friend, when seeking to obtain ordination from him, found Gilbert ``inflexible in supporting the rules and canons of the church.'' His imperious character is illustrated by his refusal to allow the civic mace to be carried before the mayor of Salisbury in processions within the cathedral precincts, for which he claimed a separate jurisdiction, disobedience to which, it is said, caused an unseemly personal scuffle between him and the mace-bearer. According to Newton, Gilbert was the first prelate to introduce at confirmations the practice of the bishop laying his hands on each candidate at the altar rails, and then retiring and solemnly pronouncing the prayer once for the whole number. This mode was first observed at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham; it ``commanded attention, and raised devotion,'' and before long became the regular manner of administering the rite."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"17366110017494150315","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"8841266254638695693","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"}]}
