These methods are widely used to compute continuum processes dominated by wave propagation. On the following day, 3 May, Godunov received an honorary degree from the University of Michigan.

Godunov's scheme is a conservative numerical scheme for solving partial differential equations. In this method, the conservative variables are considered as piecewise constant over the mesh cells at each time step and the time evolution is determined by the exact solution of the Riemann (shock tube) problem at the inter-cell boundaries (Hirsch, 1990)."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1295059937994543754","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16671464637895630418","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6905422328658452998","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"10865367442061928261","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"18153321702395861849","judgment":"no"}]}

James I raised Cecil's father to the Peerage of England, creating him Baron Cecil in 1603; Viscount Cranborne in 1604; and Earl of Salisbury in 1605. As a result, in 1605, William received the courtesy title of Viscount Cranborne. In 1608, aged 17, Cranborne's father sent him to France, but quickly recalled him to England to marry Catherine, the daughter of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk in December 1608. His father was determined that Cranborne should spend two years living abroad, and instructed him to return to France following his marriage. However, in mid-1610, James I determined to have his son Henry installed as Prince of Wales and Salisbury (who was currently serving as Lord High Treasurer) instructed his son to return for the ceremony: Cranborne subsequently held the king's train for the ceremony. Following this ceremony, Cranborne returned to Europe, this time to Italy, travelling first to Venice, then to Padua.

John has a degree from Harvard Law School, but never forgets his working-class Queens roots, nor the idea that law is about protecting the ``little guy'' from the major corporations that are his firms' key clients. He has started a clandestine affair with fellow attorney Nancy Slaton (Megyn Price), clandestine because the firm forbids lawyers from dating each other to minimize claims of sexual harassment. To the disgust of his barber father, Luis (Gregory Sierra), John wears his hair long and plays guitar; his father views him as a hippie. Greg Giraldo was in reality a graduate of Harvard Law School nearly top of his class, and became a lawyer for a while before becoming a comedian. After a year as an attorney, Giraldo fell out of love with the profession and launched his comedy career, only referring to his law background very occasionally on the stand-up circuit, until he starred in this series."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"12326035789351311160","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16671464637895630418","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"10865367442061928261","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"3027237892993046497","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6736745672381419418","judgment":"no"}]}

The cause for the controversy was that in some of Rugg's junior-high textbooks he had included some pro-socialist ideas and included some criticism of the AFA.http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2381/Rugg-Harold-1886-1960.html"}],"judgments":[{"rater":"10865367442061928261","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"3962649178407103196","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"11594982675307016661","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"3027237892993046497","judgment":"yes"}]}

Travelling eastward, at first via Varanasi, Xuanzang reached Vaisali, Pataliputra (Patna) and Bodh Gaya. He was then accompanied by local monks to Nalanda, the great Buddhist university of Indian state of Bihar, where he spent at least the next two years. He was in the company of several thousand scholar-monks, whom he praised. Xuanzang studied logic, grammar, Sanskrit, and the Yogacara school of Buddhism during his time at Nalanda. René Grousset notes that it was at Nalanda (where an ``azure pool winds around the monasteries, adorned with the full-blown cups of the blue lotus; the dazzling red flowers of the lovely kanaka hang here and there, and outside groves of mango trees offer the inhabitants their dense and protective shade'') that Xuanzang met the venerable Silabhadra, the monastery's superior. Silabhadra had dreamt of Xuanzang's arrival and that it would help spread far and wide the Holy Law. Grousset writes: ``The Chinese pilgrim had finally found the omniscient master, the incomparable metaphysician who was to make known to him the ultimate secrets of the idealist systems... The founders of Mahayana idealism, Asanga and Vasubandhu... Dignaga... Dharmapala had in turn trained Silabhadra. Siladhadra was thus in a position to make available to the Sino-Japanese world the entire heritage of Buddhist idealism, and the Siddhi Hiuan Tsang's great philosophical treatise...is none other than the Summa of this doctrine, the fruit of seven centuries of Indian Buddhist thought.''"}],"judgments":[{"rater":"7379787628707821873","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"1295059937994543754","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"652625289254394043","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"12075143618468024163","judgment":"no"}]}

Meco wanted to play the drums, but his father convinced him that the trombone was the right instrument, and at nine that was the instrument which he was to stay with, however, for Meco the slide trombone was his choice, troublesome as it was for the small statured boy to extend the slide fully at first. He joined the high school band while still attending grammar school. At 17, he won a scholarship to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, which provided him with a solid classical and jazz music education.

His father was a prominent leader of the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP). In 1911, as a small child, Mark Rein left Russia with his parents, who were escaping from the tsarist police. In 1917 he returned to Russia with his parents; his father played a role in the events of the Revolution of 1917. In 1920, aged 11, Mark Rein left Russia again with his parents. He lived mostly in Berlin and Paris. As a young man he became a member of the Menshevik RSDRP, the German Social Democratic Party and the Swedish Social Democratic Party. In 1932 he graduated from the Berlin Polytechnic. He worked as a journalist for several socialist papers. He was more sympathetic to the Soviet Union than his father, and for awhile supported the idea of a unification of social-democratic and communist parties. In 1936 he went to Spain to support the Republican, anti-fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War. On April 9, 1937, he was kidnapped in Barcelona by agents of the Soviet secret service OGPU. He was spirited to Russia, apparently with the intention of using him in the show trial of Alexey Rykov and Nikolai Bukharin. He was supposed to connect the accused in the third Moscow Trial in 1938 to the exiled Menshevik leadership. The kidnapping was apparently organised by A.M. Orlov, who supervised the kidnapping and execution of left-wing opponents of Stalin in Spain during the Civil War and later defected to the USA. In spite of frantic efforts by Rafail Abramovich and western socialist supporters, he was never seen alive again and is thought to have been murdered by the OGPU."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1666978224370465111","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"15105723552637340343","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16671464637895630418","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"6968726908160095830","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"3027237892993046497","judgment":"yes"}]}

Bandler then approached John Grinder, then a linguistics lecturer.

Just before Fritz Perls died he completed the first draft of The Gestalt Approach which he gave to Robert Spitzer. Bandler helped Spitzer edit this draft and also listen to recordings of Perls working with clients which were transcribed for a second book titled, Eye Witness to Therapy. At the time, Bandler was an undergraduate student at University of California, Santa Cruz, and had begun running Gestalt therapy workshops to refine his skills. While at UCSC, Bandler invited assistant professor of linguistics Dr. John Grinder to observe his Gestalt workshops, to help build an explicit model of how Bandler (and Perls) did Gestalt therapy.

The Internal Revenue Service and Virginia Department of Taxation granted six-month extensions to individuals affected by the shootings. Virginia Governor Tim Kaine returned early from a trade mission to Tokyo, Japan, and declared a state of emergency in Virginia, enabling him to immediately deploy state personnel, equipment, and other resources in the aftermath of the shootings. Governor Kaine later created an eight-member panel, including former United States Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, to review all aspects of the Virginia Tech massacre, from Cho's medical history to the school's widely criticized delay in warning students of danger and locking down the campus after the bodies of Cho's first two victims were discovered. In August 2007, the panel concluded, among more than 20 major findings, that the Virginia Tech Police Department ``did not take sufficient action to deal with what might happen if the initial lead proved false''. The panel made more than 70 preventative recommendations, directed to colleges, universities, mental health providers, law enforcement officials, emergency service providers, law makers and other public officials in Virginia and elsewhere. While the panel did find errors in judgment and procedure, the ultimate conclusion was that Cho himself was responsible for his own actions, and to imply that anyone else was accountable ``would be wrong.'' The Review Panel validated public criticisms that university officials erred in ``prematurely concluding that their initial lead in the double homicide was a good one,'' and in delaying a campus-wide notification for almost two hours. The report analyzed the feasibility of a campus lockdown and essentially agreed with police testimony that such an action was not feasible. The report concluded that the toll could have been reduced if the university had made an immediate decision to cancel classes and a stronger, clearer initial alert of the presence of a gunman."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"12326035789351311160","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"11594982675307016661","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"15508466506567648824","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"1264223381988340244","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"796504546363744426","judgment":"no"}]}
